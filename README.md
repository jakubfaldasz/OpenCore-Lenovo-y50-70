# OpenCore-Lenovo-y50-70
## OpenCore EFI working with BigSur.

### For installing use PRE_EFI.
### After installation use POST_EFI.

#### This is a edited repo of [GeekyCoder7](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links) EFI.

### Specs:

Intel Core i7-4720HQ
Intel HD4600 integrated GPU
Nvidia GTX 960M 4GB (unsupported)
16GB DDR4 Ram
Broadcom BCM94352Z (Network card)


### Caveats:

  * There are some issues with AppleALC layout-id, for now it is set to alcid=15 which makes audio from headphones and built-in speakers work correctly, but there are some issues with microphone (recording only right channel).
